<h2> The First Unitarian Church at Rochester </h2>
![](/assets/ya.jpg)


The First Unitarian Church was made by Louis Kahn, first concieved of in 
1959 and finished in 1962. It served as a space not only for Unitarian 
Universalists, but also as a community center and a teaching center for 
the schoolchildren that attended the church. Kahn's studied the Unitarian 
philosophy extensively while creating the building, and it reflected in both the 
conceptual and physical design of the church. Kahn most famously started the 
design of the church with the form drawing shown below:

Kahn believed that the 'form' of a building was something immaterial that would 
influence the material design of the building, and that said physical design, 
once constructed, would again reflect the immaterial form that the architect had 
in mind. In Kahn's words, 'the form realization of Unitarian activity was bound 
around that which is Question. Question eternal of why anything', hence the 
question mark in the middle. Surrounding the question mark was a series of 
concentric circles, representing the ambulatory, corridor, and church school. 
This again is a reflection of Unitarian values; everyone, no matter where they 
might come from, is seeking the same thing.

The evolution of the design is shown below, and it can be seen how the final 
design reflects the form drawing:

It can also be seen how the first three designs don't quite reflect the form 
drawing Kahn had in mind. Separating one part of the church from the whole meant 
symbolically that some people weren't seeking the same thing as others, which 
wasn't in line with Universalist Unitarian belief.

The two images below are both designs of the building, but the first one was 
drawn in 1959, towards the beginning of the building, and the last one was 
drawn in 1962. It's immediately apparant that the second drawing is one that 
feels more central and unified, while elements of the first design (especially 
the classrooms) feel much more isolated.

Below are two images of the exterior, which show values important to both Kahn 
and the Unitarian body. The first picture shows off the light towers and the 
material of the building, both things that were integral to Kahn's beliefs while 
making this building. Kahn was famous for his use of natural light inside 
buildings, and the first exterior picture shows the way that light was 
implemented for the interior. Kahn loved light, but he didn't want direct natural 
light, as he believed that direct light (which induces shadow) would 
obscure the form of the interior. So instead softer, indirect natural light was 
used. This is show through the crevassed brick walls, which block direct 
sunlight, and the four towers at the top of the building, which would let light 
in, but not directly from above. As well, the pictures show the material of the 
building, mainly brick. Kahn wanted something that reflected the importance of 
the building, and a unyielding material, like brick, was one of the ways he 
thought that importance could be shown best.

The second picture provides a different perspective. It seems to show off the 
lack of grandeur of the building, which might seem confusing to some, considering 
that it's a church. However, this lack of grandeur plays quite well into 
Unitarian beliefs. Most churches are grand and huge, intending to show off the 
might of God, and man's comparative lowness. The Unitarian belief doens't believe 
in that great contrast, but instead "the dignity, rather than the depravity of 
man". The building was constructed not to be a imposing figure of God, but rather 
a reflection of the softer aspects - forgiveness, kindness, and love.

Two pictures of the interior can be seen below. You can immediately see the soft 
and indirect light from the interior, and also the lack of elevation of the 
podium - another reflection of Unitarian values considering everyone as equal.

This is an image from Google Earth showing the surroundings of the church. The 
building is very obviously in a suburban context, which shows both its history 
and its beliefs - a place not for worship necessarily, but rather a place for 
meeting, community, and understanding. It's in a location accessible to all, 
whether low-status or high-status.
